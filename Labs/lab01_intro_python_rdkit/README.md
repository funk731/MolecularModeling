Notes: Generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT and Gemini, were used while creating this lecture notebook.

## Overview

This lecture provides a foundational understanding of Python programming and introduces the RDKit package for cheminformatics. The session covers essential Python syntax and operations, including variables, data types, conditional statements, loops, functions, and string manipulations. The lecture then transitions to RDKit, focusing on basic usage, molecule visualization, molecular descriptors, file reading and writing, and introductory data analysis using Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib.
