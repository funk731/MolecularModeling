    "# Molecular Representations\n",
    "\n",
    "Molecular representations are essential tools that allow us to describe the structure and properties of molecules in a format suitable for computational analysis. They capture key details like the types of atoms, how they're connected, and their spatial arrangements. Common representations include SMILES strings, molecular graphs, and chemical descriptors, each serving different purposes in tasks like predicting molecular behavior, searching databases, or modeling chemical reactions. These representations are widely used in fields like drug discovery and materials science, providing a bridge between complex molecular structures and computational tools. This lab will only cover the molecular representations, and in the next lab, these representations will be used for chemical data processing and visualization.\n",

    "##### Invariant and Equivariant Graph Representations\n",
    "\n",
    "**Invariant Representations:**\n",
    "- Definition: Representations that remain unchanged under transformations like rotations, translations, or permutations of the graph nodes.\n",
    "- Application: Used in predicting molecular properties where the output should not change regardless of molecule orientation or atom ordering.\n",
    "- Benefit: Ensures consistency and robustness in models by ignoring irrelevant variations in molecule representation.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Equivariant Representations:**\n",
    "- Definition: Representations that change predictably with transformations (e.g., rotations or reflections) of the graph, preserving geometric relationships.\n",
    "- Application: Useful in tasks requiring spatial awareness, such as predicting molecular interactions or forces.\n",
    "- Benefit: Captures directional and geometric properties accurately, enhancing the model's understanding of spatial dynamics.\n",
    "\n",
    "These representations are crucial in advanced modeling tasks, ensuring that molecular graphs are handled in ways that reflect their physical and chemical properties accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the sake of simplicity, only a simple example of invariant representations is demonstrated in the following code cells. However, there are great reseources and papers that explain these topics in depth. One of the best summary and practice is from [TeachOpenCADD's talktorial T036](https://github.com/volkamerlab/teachopencadd/tree/master/teachopencadd/talktorials/T036_e3_equivariant_gnn). This tutorial goes through a good summary of these topics and demonstrates a great example how these representations can improve molecular modeling."
