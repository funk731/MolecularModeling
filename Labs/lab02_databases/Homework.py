'''
    Let's use what we have learned in Databases lab. For this homework,
    we will pull data for a target protein. I already chose a UniProt ID
    that we will be collecting information about. Let's start ...

    Remember you only need to edit the code when you see a TODO or ...

print(f"Selected target ChEMBL ID is: {chembl_id}")

# Now, we want to fetch the related bioactivity data.
# First, use the filter method to retrieve only the data
# you need. Also, obtain ONLY the following information:
# "activity_id", "assay_chembl_id", "assay_description",
# "assay_type", "molecule_chembl_id", "type", "relation",
# "target_chembl_id", "target_organism", "standard_units",
# and "standard_value"
bioactivities = activity_api.filter(
    target_chembl_id=chembl_id, # TODO add other arguments 
).only(

    ...
)
bioactivities = pd.DataFrame.from_dict(bioactivities)
print(bioactivities.head())
print(f"Number of activity records: {len(bioactivities)}")

# Next part would be curation and preprocessing of the data
# for visualizations and analysis, but we'll come to that later
