# Introduction to Chemical Databases in Python

Author(s): Enes Kelestemur

Notes: Generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT and Gemini, were used while creating this lecture notebook.

## Overview

This tutorial provides an introduction to key chemical databases, including ChEMBL, PubChem, and the Protein Data Bank (PDB). It covers how to access, retrieve, and utilize chemical and biological data from these resources using Python. The tutorial focuses on utilizing Python libraries to interact with these databases programmatically. Chemical Data processing and curation is the topic of lab 3, so for further exploration of Chemical data, refer to lab 4.

## Lab Structure

### 1. ChEMBL

- **Introduction**: Overview of ChEMBL and its significance in drug discovery.
- **Retrieving Molecules**: How to retrieve molecular data using the ChEMBL API.
- **Exploring Data**: Basic methods for exploring and understanding ChEMBL data.

### 2. PubChem

- **Introduction**: Overview of PubChem and its role in cheminformatics.
- **Data Access**: Techniques for accessing PubChem data via the `PubChemPy` library.
- **Exploring Data**: Methods for exploring and retrieving PubChem data, including structure searching.

### 3. PDB

- **Introduction**: Understanding the importance of PDB in structural biology.
- **Data Retrieval**: Accessing PDB data using `Biopython`.
- **Exploring Structures**: Methods for exploring PDB structures in Python using `nglview`.

## Learning Outcomes

By the end of this tutorial, participants will be able to:

- Retrieve and explore data from ChEMBL, PubChem, and the Protein Data Bank (PDB) using Python.
