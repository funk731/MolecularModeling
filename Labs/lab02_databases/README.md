# Introduction to Chemical Databases in Python

Author(s): Enes Kelestemur


Notes: Generative AI tools, such as ChatGPT and Gemini, were used while creating this lecture notebook.

## Overview

This tutorial provides an introduction to key chemical databases, including ChEMBL, PubChem, and the Protein Data Bank (PDB). It covers how to access, retrieve, and utilize chemical and biological data from these resources using Python. The tutorial focuses on utilizing Python libraries to interact with these databases programmatically. Chemical Data processing and curation is the topic of lab 3, so for further exploration of Chemical data, refer to lab 4.
